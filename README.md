<h1>Learning Vietnamese Today - Extra Credit Project</h1>
<br/>
<h2>My Proposal Included</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I will use all the languages I have learnt in class: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.</li>
  <li>My website will include at least 1 makeup quiz page.</li>
  <li>My website will include at least 1 video that is created by myself.</li>
  <li>I will need to submit before the deadline on July 23rd, 2018.</li>
</ul>
<h2>My Project Tracking Path</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I have started on the project since Saturday July 7, 2018.</li>
  <li>I have done all the pages needed under HTML file after a week.</li>
  <li>I have done the one video and quiz script in the third day of my second week.</li>
  <li>I have spent one hour everyday to figure out how to make a quiz. I have tried AngulaJS but fail.</li>
  <li>I ended up using basic JavaScript to make the quiz under a simple theme.</li>
  <li>The webpage does not accept Vietnamese. Therefore, I have to use a tip from a coding website in Vietnam. However, the tip makes fix the language error, but not letting me link to my CSS file. So, I have to copy all everything in my style.css into the quiz.html file.</li>
  <li>I have successfully use header.php and footer.php in all pages, except quiz.html.</li>
</ul>
